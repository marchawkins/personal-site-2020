Surprised the kids with their first trip to Disney World, and, coincidentally, their first time on an airplane. Photos don't do this place justice. Just a great trip - exhausting, but a great time had by all. Stayed at the Beach Club Resort and hit all the parks this time around. A video of us telling the kids the morning we left, and a second of them dancing at Disney Springs.
