Sideshow has released (link: https://www.sideshow.com/collectibles/star-wars-the-child-sideshow-collectibles-400369 text: The Child life-size figure) from The Mandalorian and people are loving it. So cool to see one of our pieces hit the mainstream media. It even made it on a Star Wars promo on ESPN's Monday Night Football (that's what's playing on the TV).
